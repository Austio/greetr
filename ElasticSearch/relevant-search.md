#### Chapter 1 - What is relevancy

Definition: The Practice of improving search results `for users` by satisfying the `information needs` in the context of a particular `user experience` while balancing how raking `impacts business needs`.

When thinking about relevancy, consider these perspectives
 - What is content (tweets, beanie babies, news)
 - What sort of user (TechSavvy, professionals, shoppers)
 - What type of search (Japanese, Filled with Jargon, People)
 - What do users expect (Library and Catalog, shopping experience)
 - What does employer hope to get out of this
 - What are the valuable features of our content
 - What are the valuable signals that things are going well with search

#### Chapter 8 - Providing Relevant Feedback

Problems with results and suggestions as you type
 - Confusing for users to discern between them
 - Confusing for users to know why a search surfaced
 - Unless matching on 1 field (title) it is hard to provide feedback on why a search surfaced
 - Google eliminates this by only displaying search suggestions in query and surfacing results in result area
