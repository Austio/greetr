#### Eval

Executes a chunk of code

```
method = 'puts'

eval "#{method} 'howdy'"
```

#### Instance Eval

Like eval with w benefits 
 - block instead of a string
 - can be called with a receiver 
 
 
```
instance_eval do 
  puts self
end
# main

"cat".instance_eval do 
        puts self
      end
# cat

"cat".instance_eval do 
        puts upcase
      end
# CAT (implicit receiver of self, which is "cat")
``` 

You can see this even better in a class

```
class Thing
  def initialize
    @var = 'foo'
  end
  
  private
  
  def inner_secret
    "shhh"
  end
end

t = Thing.new
t.instance_eval { puts @var }  
# "foo"

# private method no long private b/c private just means only through implicit receiver
t.instance_eval { puts inner_secret }
```

Can also define methods inside of ruby

```
animal = "cat"

animal.instance_eval do 
  def speak
    puts "miow"
  end
end
```

Keep in mind that it is on the instance, so if you call it on a constant that is a reference to a class object it is the same logic

```
class Dave
  def self.howdy
    "howdy"
  end
end

class Dave
end

Dave.instance_eval do 
  def howdy
    "howdy"
  end
end
```
