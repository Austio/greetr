### Definitions

 - Image: application we want to run
 - Container: process running an instance of an image
 - May containers can run off the same image

 - alpine: super tiny security focused distribution

#### Containers
these are really just a process running on the OS

```
docker run --name mongo -d mongo

ps -aux | grep mongo
999      15154  2.9  0.1 1085328 73396 ?       Ssl  11:59   0:00 mongod --bind_ip_all
talos    15297  0.0  0.0  14432  1052 pts/3    S+   11:59   0:00 grep --color=auto mongo

docker top mongo
UID   PID    PPID    C   STIME  TTY  TIME      CMD
999   15154  15132   0   11:59  ?    00:00:01  mongod --bind_ip_all
```


### Commands 
 
#### Management
 - start (start one or more stopped containers)
 - run (run command in a *new* container)
   => docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx
   --detach (-d) 
   --name give it a name to connect with in the future
   --env (-e) pass in environmental variables
   
 - stop => docker container stop   
 - ls
   => show current: docker container ls
   => show all history: docker container ls -a
   id: unique for container
   name: unique for container, but is something we can create
 - rm
   => delete non running containers: docker container rm
   => delete force: docker container rm -f
   
   
#### Monitoring
 - top => docker top nginx
   lists information about the running container
 - docker container inspect (container name)
   lists information about how a container was started
 - docker container stats (container name)
   live updating ability to see resources
  
#### Connecting
  - run -it
    start new container and the command to execute interactively.  So for instance on this you can see that we have told nginx to run with the bash instead of the default command we have in docker
```
docker container run -it --name proxy nginx bash

talos@Talos-Desktop:~/projects/learning$ docker container ls -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS                NAMES
be83299c5b34        nginx               "bash"                   17 seconds ago      Exited (0) 7 seconds ago                        proxy
8b309018883b        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   3 hours ago         Up 6 minutes               0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   nginx

```
  - exec -it
    run additional command in existing container
```
docker exec -it nginx bash
# gives me a bash process inside of any container
```    
      
  -i -> keep it open
  -t -> tty like ssh
##### Command analysis: Run
 - docker container run --publish 80:80 --name webhost -d nginx:1.11 nginx -T
                                  host port               version    change CMD run on start    
 - docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx
 1. Look for that image locally
   - if doesn't find go to docker hub to find image and caches locally in download
 2. Creates a new container based on that images, prepares to start
 3. Gives it virtual IP on private network inside docker engine
 4. Opens up port on host and forwards to port 80 in container
 5. Starts using CMD in dockerFile  
 
#### Networking
 - docker container port webhost (show the ports exposed on the thing)
 - docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' webhost
   - show me the ip address on one of these containers
   
## Assignments

### Containers
 - Setup multiple containers on different processes, apache (8080), nginx (80) and mysql (3306)
 
```
docker container run --publish 80:80 --name nginx -d nginx
docker container run --publish 8080:80 --name httpd -d httpd
docker container run --name mysql --publish 3306:3306 -d mysql

docker container ls
docker ps

docker container stop nginx httpd mysql
``` 
    
### Networking
Defaults
 - Each container connects to a private virtual network "bridge"
 - Each virtual network routes through NAT firewall on the host IP
 - All containers on a virtual network can talk to each other
 - Best Practices is to create a new virtual network for each "app"
   - "my_web_app" mysqsl/php/apache
   - "api" for mongo nodejs
   
- On boot
 When you start, docker connects all containers to the bridge network /docker0 and those containers can talk however they want
