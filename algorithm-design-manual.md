### CP 1

When interrogating an algorithm for correctness attempt to demonstrate incorrectness
 - Verifiability: Demonstrate a counter-example (prefer a simple way)
 - Think Small: Look at several small examples (0, -1, 1, etc)
 - Think Exhaustively: Consider all permutations (as in intervals you can only have disjoint, overlapping and nesting)
 - Hunt for the weakness: eg why would the biggest prove the wrong thing to do?
 - Go for a tie: Provide instances where everything is the same size
 - Seek extremes: Huge/Tiny, Left/Right, Near/Far
