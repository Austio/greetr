## The Squat Bible

Think of squats more holistically as a meaure of mobility.  There are powerlifters who can squat enormous amounts but can't perform a front squat or pistol squat.  This is an imbalance and is one of the primary drivers of injury.  

### Absolutes of Squating
 - Toe Angle: Toes should be pointed relatively strait forward with a slight 5-7 degree out toe angle.  For barbell squats this can be a bit more.
 - Tripod Foot: Weight should be evenly disributed across the 'tripod'.  The heel and base of toe by both the pinky and big toes.
 - Hip Hinge: Squat must start with driving the Hips Back and bringing the chest forward.
 - Create External Rotation Torque: Squeeze your Glutes and Drive Knees Out.  If you do this properly you will feel the outside muscles of legs engage and knees will be drawn into a good position.
 - Postural Integrity: Maintain neutrality and straightness in trunk and neck.  Center of gravity must be over middle of feet.  Neck should be nuetral depending on torso angle.  When over knees (bodyweight squat) you should look forward or slightly down.  When more vertical (front or overhead squat) look forward or slightly up.  A queue to help maintain ideal straight trunk is to hold arms straight in front of you parallel to floor during the bodyweight squat.
 - Width of Feet: This will vary by person.  Good starting is shoulder width then adjust to allow a deep squat.
