### SICP: Structured Interpretation of Computer Programs

#### Lecture 1
Computer Science is really about controlling complexity in large programs.  
It is different than physical systems b/c it is an imagined system, not real.  Electrical engineers have physical constraints when building (tolerance, noise).  Constraints in CS are only the limitations of our own minds.

 - Declarative - What to do
 - Imperative - How to do something
 - Process - Like a magical spirit that lives in computer and does something
 - Procedure - Pattern of Rules, ways to talk about Imperative knowledge

##### Techniques
Black Box Abstractions (function) - Suppress Detail
Conventional Interfaces
 - Think adding 2 things together.  Numbers, Vectors, Sin waves.  
 - How do i structure that addition in a way so that the next thing that comes along will be able to be plugged in
Metalinguistic Abstraction
