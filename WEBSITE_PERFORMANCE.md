## Concepts
 - Measurement vs Perception - balance your measurement
 - Efficiency - Speed vs Memory (bandwidth)
 - Performance - Benchmark and Optimize, you *must* quantify these and do user studies
 - Optimize the Critical Paths - NonCritical optimization is root of all evil, immature optimization is the root of all evil
 - Speed, 100ms response is perceived as instantaneous - 1000ms perceived delay
 - Inefficiency is Systemic
 - Take a 'Performant by Default'
