### Setup
 - https://github.com/neilwithdata/mastery-with-sql

### Cool shortcuts in datagrip/dbeaver

 - Ctl+Space - Displays list of columns that you can select from a table when you write out the `select from TABLE` if cursor is in between select and from keywords
 
### Good to knows
 - '' vs ""  single quotes is for values, double is for table/database identifiers
 - Dates: Always use iso standard that is not ambiguous where updated_at > 'yyyy-mm-dd' so that when cast it will not be wierd
 - equality - sql uses 3 value comparrison, true false and unknowing, comparing anything with null is an unknowing
 - where will only return values that result in true
 - like: % is wildcare *, _ is exactly 1
 - order by: `nulls (first|last)` works on pg!  asc is default ordering
 - distinct vs distinct on: distinct is unique by tuple distinct on is more like a group by and column based
 - be careful on multi table joins, inner joins on a next step table basically cancel out outer joins on previous joins

### Common Definitions and Basics

Common definitions
 - Constraints: ensure right data goes in. provide Referential integrety (foreign keys, primary keys, not null) make sure validity of data is correct (join table).
 - Normalization: ensures things are mapped correctly, a film with actor_1, actor_2, etc vs an actor_files join table
 - CTE: Common Table Expression.  Extract table from query
 
Derived Queries create a new representations of another column or group of columns

```
select 
 3 * 3 as "multiplications",
 film_duration,
 film_duration * 24 as film_duration_hours
from films;

|9|1|24|
|9|3|72|...

select 
  return_date - rental_date as duration_rented
from rentals;
```

Functions can combine with Derived Queries to make results do hula dances
```
select
  first_name, 
  last_name,
  initcap(first_name || " " || last_name) as "Full Name"
from actors;

|JIM|JONES|Jim Jones|
```

#### Order of Execution
famous weasels gave him some overdue love

 1. from: pick tables to be queried
 2. where: filter the rows
 3. group by: aggregate
 4. having: filter aggregates
 5. select: select columns that appear in output
 6. order by: sort rows
 7. limit
 
This order is why you can't use alias table names in a where clause that are defined in a select.

#### Order By / Limit

Always define an order by when doing a limit.  OW it will return any order and is not defined well.

Offset is supported by postgres/mysql ANSI Standard looks like this
```
offset 10
limit 5;

offset 10 rows fetch next 5 rows only;
```

#### Case things

Case columns will return `null` if there are not matches

```
select title, length
  case
    when length <= 60 then 'short'
    when length > 60 and length <= 120 then 'long'
    when length > 120 then 'very long'
    when length is null then 'this film does not have length'
    else 'unknown'
  end as length_description
from film;  

// NOTE: simple form will not handle null
  case length
    when <= 60 then 'short'
    when > 60 and length <= 120 then 'long'
    when > 120 then 'very long'
    else 'unknown'
  end as length_description
  
```
### Aggs | grouping

 - After a group by, the only operation you can perform on other columns are aggregates of other columns (sum, avg, etc) because all of the rows are essentially squashed into a single row
 - having = where for groups
 
 #### Case in aggregate/group by
 
 You can use cases to group, the cases groups must match exactly or do something like group by (1)
 
 ```
 select 
   case
     when length < 60 then 'short'
     when length between 60 and 120 'medium'
     when length > 120 then 'long'
     else 'short
   end,
   count(*)
 from film
 group by 1;
 -- or group by ...fully repeat case statement.
 ```

You can also do case statements in aggregates

```
select
  sum(case when rating in ('R', 'NC-17') then 1 end) as adult_films,
  count(*) as total_films
  100.0 * sum(case when rating in ('R', 'NC-17') then 1 end) / count(*) as percentage
from film

-- psql gives us something specific called a filter we can use
select
  count(*) filter(where rating in ('R', 'NC-17')) as adult_films
```
 
Other Neat Queries

```
-- Return a list of customer where all payments theyâ€™ve made have been over $2
select customer_id
from payment
group  by 1
having every(amount >= 2.00) -- alias for bool_and

-- generate a histogram
select rating, repeat('+', (count(*) / 10)::int) as "count/10"
from film
where rating is not null
group by rating;
```

### Data Types

- pg_typeof(X) -> return the type of something
- cast with 
  - `int '33'`
  - ansi cast('33' as int)
  - '33'::int

#### String
- char(n) is legacy and right pads with 0 when saving
- || characters that are null results in the whole set being null 'foo' || 'bar' || null is null
 - use concat string function instaed
 
#### Numbers
- ints are generally 2, 4 or 8 bytes, they are whole.  count(*) returns a big int (8 bytes)
- numerics are fixed/floating
- ciel, floor, round, be aware of the type (numeric, precision, int, etc)

```
List percentage of total for NC-17, G, PG, PG-13, NC-17, and R

select
    ceil(sum(case when rating in ('NC-17') then 1 end)/cast(count(*) as numeric) * 100) as "NC-17",
    ceil(sum(case when rating in ('R') then 1 end)/cast(count(*) as numeric) * 100) as "R",
    ceil(sum(case when rating in ('G') then 1 end)/cast(count(*) as numeric) * 100) as "G",
    ceil(sum(case when rating in ('PG-13') then 1 end)/cast(count(*) as numeric) * 100) as "PG-13",
    ceil(sum(case when rating in ('PG') then 1 end)/cast(count(*) as numeric) * 100) as "PG"
    -- or with pg filter: round(100.0 * count(*) filter(where rating = 'NC-17') / count(*)) as "% NC-17",
from film;

% NC-17|% PG|% G|% R|% PG-13|
-------|----|---|---|-------|
     21|  19| 18| 20|     22|

select int '33'; -- int4 33
select int '33.3'; -- invalid input for integer
select cast(33.3 as int); -- int4 33
select cast(33.8 as int); -- int4 34
select 33::text; -- text 33
select 'hello'::varchar(2); -- varchar he
select cast(35000 as smallint); -- smalling out of range error
select 12.1::numeric(1,1); -- numeric field overflow
```
#### Dates
- date: use iso 'yyyy-mm-dd'
- time: 'HH:MM:DD'
- timestamp
- timestamptz: note: the results of times are relative to the locally set time
  - '2018-01-1 3:00 Australia/Brisbane'::timestamptz
  - '2018-01-1 3:00 +10'::timestamptz
  - '2018-01-1 3:00 AEST'::timestamptz
  - show timezone
- intervals
  - select timestamptz '2018-01-01 08:35 + 8' - timestamptz '2018-01-10 08:35 EST'
- date_part('hour', '2018-01-01 12:23') will return the minute value, not the total minutes (here 23 instead of much higher)
  - use date_part('epoch') to get seconds between them
- date_trunc('hour', ...) great for doing group by for a specific month/year 
- current_date, current_time, current_timestamp

```
--Get rental duration (which is an int) and print as interval of days

select title,
       extract(day from make_interval(days := rental_duration)) || ' days',
       extract(day from make_interval(days := rental_duration)) + 1 || ' days'
from film;

select
  title,
  cast(rental_duration || ' days' as interval)  as duration,
  cast(rental_duration || ' days' as interval) + interval '1 day'  as "duration + 1"
from film;

Group sales by hour of day
select extract(hour from rental_date) as part, count(*)
from rental
group by extract(hour from rental_date)
order by part asc;

-- Rentals where they occurred on last day of month
select count(*)
from payment
where date_part('day', (payment_date + INTERVAL '1 days')) = 1

select count(*) as "total # EOM rentals"
from rental
where date_trunc('month', rental_date) + interval '1 month' - interval '1 day'
        = date_trunc('day', rental_date);

-- series of every first day of month
select generate_series('2018-01-01'::timestamp, '2018-12-12'::timestamp, '1 month')

-- count number of letters in first name
select
       first_name,
       (CHAR_LENGTH(first_name) - CHAR_LENGTH(REPLACE(first_name, 'A', '')))
from customer
order by 2;

-- Sum money from weekends

select sum(amount)
from payment
where  EXTRACT(ISODOW FROM payment_date) IN (6, 7)
```

### Joins

The cartesian product of 2 tables is all permutations of combinations between them

The Cross Join is the Cartesian Product of two tables

|Table A|Table B|(Cross Join) Cartesian Product TA*TB|
|---|---|---|
|1,2,3|A,B,C|1A,1B,1C,2A,2B,2C,3A,3B,3C|

```
select * from a
cross join b on a.foo = b.foo

-- older style cross join syntax
select * from a, b
where a.foo = b.foo

-- fancier using style
select * from a
cross join b using(foo)
```

Inner Joins are a Cross Join + a Filter
 - When inner joining, output does not show up if there is not a matching row in both sides of join
 - shorthand for join is using
 
|Table A|Table B|(Cross Join) Cartesian Product TA*TB|
|---|---|---|
|1,2,3|A,B,C|1A,1B,1C,2A,2B,2C,3A,3B,3C| 
 
```
select * from a
inner join b on a.foo = b.foo
-- inner join b using (foo)
```

Outer Joins are Inner Join + adding rows back from one of the joined tables
 - left outer adds rows back from left table
 - right outer adds from the right side
 - full outer adds back from both side
 
Self Joins are easy until we only want unique items

```
C  1  2  3
1 11 12 13
2 21 22 23
3 31 32 33

select * from c as c1
inner join c as c2 
 where c1.id != c2.id

-- Would only eliminate self paired row down center (11, 22, 33)

To eliminate the duplicates of 21 with 12, you would need to do <
select * from c as c1
inner join c as c2 
 where c1.id < c2.id

-- would only select 12, 13, 23, which is what we want here
```

Say we were wanting to se

#### Join Exercises

```
Write a query to show for each customer
-- how many different (unique) films they've rented and
-- how many different (unique) actors they've seen in films they've rented
select c.customer_id, count(distinct(f.film_id)), count(distinct(fa.actor_id)) from customer c
join rental r on c.customer_id = r.customer_id
join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id

--  Order the output showing the lowest in-stock first so we know to buy more!

-- notice that we count on the right joined table column so that we do not count null values as 1 row in the count result
--   Not doing this step would cause our values to be 1 when there were no films in inventory
select film.title, count(inventory_id) from film
left outer join inventory using (film_id)
group by film_id
order by 2 asc;


-- Write a query to return how many copies of each film are available in each store, including zero counts if there are none.
-- Order by count so we can easily see first which films need to be restocked in each store

    and r1.rental_date < r2.rental_date;
```

### Subqueries

#### Uncorrelated Subqueries
Queries that contain other queries that could completely stand on their own.

```
-- 7.1 Write a query to return all the customers who made a rental on the first day of rentals
-- (without hardcoding the date for the first day of rentals in your query)
select * from rental
  where date_trunc('day', rental_date) = (select date_trunc('day', min(rental_date))
  from rental);

select email, rental_date from customer
join rental using (customer_id)
where date_trunc('day', rental.rental_date) =  (select date_trunc('day', min(rental.rental_date)) from rental);

-- 7.2 Using a subquery, return the films that don't have any actors.
-- Now write the same query using a left join. Which solution do you think is better? Easier to read?

select * from film
 left join film_actor using (film_id) where film_actor.actor_id is null;

select * from film
  where film.film_id not in (select distinct film_id from film_actor)

-- 7.3 You intend to write a humorous email to congratulate some customers on their poor taste in films.
-- To that end, write a query to return the customers who rented out the least popular film (that is,
-- the film least rented out - if there is more than one, pick the one with the lowest film ID)

select film.title, customer.email from film
join inventory using (film_id)
join rental using (inventory_id)
join customer using (customer_id)
where film.film_id = (select film_id from film
    left join inventory using (film_id)
    left join rental using (inventory_id)
    group by film_id
    having count(rental_id)  > 0
    order by count(rental_id), film_id
    limit 1);
```

#### Correlated Subqueries 
A subquery that references something in an outer table and cannot stand on its own

```
-- 7.4 Write a query to return the countries in our database that have more than 15 cities
select country.country from country
where (
    select count(*)
    from city
    where city.country_id = country.country_id
    ) > 15

-- 7.5 Write a query to return for each customer the store they most commonly rent from

select c.email, (
    select store.store_id from customer
    join rental using (customer_id)
    join inventory using (inventory_id)
    join store on store.store_id = inventory.store_id
    where customer.email = c.email
    group by store.store_id
    order by count(rental_id) desc
    limit 1
) from customer as c

-- Solution
select
  c.customer_id,
  c.first_name,
  c.last_name,
  (select i.store_id
   from rental as r
     inner join inventory as i using (inventory_id)
   where r.customer_id = c.customer_id
   group by i.store_id
   order by count(*) desc
   limit 1) as "Favourite Store"
from customer as c;

-- 7.6 In the customer table, each customer has a store ID which is the store they originally registered at.
-- Write a query to list for each customer whether they have ever rented from a different store than that one they registered at.
-- Return 'Y' if they have, and 'N' if they haven't.

select c.email, (
    select
      case count(*)
      when 0 then 'N'
      else 'Y'
      end
    from customer
    join rental using (customer_id)
    join inventory using (inventory_id)
    join store on inventory.store_id = store.store_id
    where c.customer_id = customer.customer_id
      and store.store_id != c.store_id
    ) from customer as c

-- solution
select c.first_name, c.last_name,
  case
    when exists
      (select *
       from rental as r
         inner join inventory as i using (inventory_id)
       where r.customer_id = c.customer_id
         and i.store_id != c.store_id) then 'Y'
    else 'N'
  end as "HasRentedOtherStore"
from customer as c;
```

#### Table Subqueries
Where you create a table you select from as a subquery and you can rename columns as needed form it

```
select *
from (select customer_id, count(*) from rental group by customer_id) as t

-- You can reference the tables indirectly
select customer_id, count
from (select customer_id, count(*) from rental group by customer_id) as t

-- You can also rename the returned queries from the subquery
select t.the_id, t.the_count
from (select customer_id, count(*) from rental group by customer_id) as t(the_id, the_count)
```

You can also create tables with values inline.

```
select *
from
(values
        ('short', 0, 60),
        ('medium', 60, 120),
        ('long', 120, 10000)) as t("desc", "min", "max")
        
-- useful when replacing a case statement

select t.desc, film.*
from
(values
        ('short', 0, 60),
        ('medium', 60, 120),
        ('long', 120, 10000)) as t("desc", "min", "max")
join film on film.length >= t.min and film.length < t.max;
```


-- 7.7 Write a query to return each customer 4 times

```
select first_name, last_name from customer
cross join (values (1),(2),(3),(4)) as t("times_to_repeat_this");;
```

-- 7.8 Write a query to return how many rentals the business gets on average on each day of the week.
-- Order the results to show the days of the week with the highest average number of rentals first
-- (use the round function to round the average so it's a nice whole number).
-- Have a look at the to_char function to obtain the day name given a timestamp.
-- For simplicity, don't worry about days in which there were no rentals.

```
select (rent_totals.total_rentals / day_count.total_days) as average_per_day, rent_totals.day_of_week from
(select
  count(rental_id) as total_rentals,
  to_char(rental_date, 'Day') as day_of_week from rental
group by 2) as rent_totals
join (select count(*) as total_days, day_of_week
from (
         select distinct(to_char(rental_date, 'J')) as julian_date, to_char(rental_date, 'Day') as day_of_week
         from rental
     ) as dates
group by 2) as day_count
on day_count.day_of_week = rent_totals.day_of_week
order by 1 desc;

select to_char(t.day, 'Day'), round(avg(count)) from (select date_trunc('day', rental.rental_date), count(*) from rental
group by 1) as t("day", "count")
group by 1
order by 2 desc;

-- Solution 
select
  to_char(rent_day, 'Day') as day_name,
  round(avg(num_rentals)) as average
from
  (select date_trunc('day', rental_date) as rent_day, count(*) as num_rentals
   from rental
   group by rent_day) as T
group by day_name
order by average desc;
```

#### Lateral subqueries

These allow you to do a join on a correlated subquery.  Notice in the example below that we are able to use outer_customer in the inner joined table

```
-- 7.9 Write a query to return for each customer the first 'PG' film that they rented (include customers who have never rented a 'PG' film as well)

select outer_customer.email, t.title, t.rental_date from customer as outer_customer
left outer join lateral (
  select rental.customer_id, film.title, rental.rental_date from rental
  join inventory using (inventory_id)
  join film using (film_id)
  where rental.customer_id = outer_customer.customer_id
    and film.rating = 'PG'
  order by rental_date desc
  limit 1
    ) as t on outer_customer.customer_id = t.customer_id;
```

#### Common Table Expressions (CTE)

These allow us to pull out tables: Syntax in postgres is as follows

```
with TABLE__NAME(column_names*) as (SQL_QUERY)


-- 7.10 Write a query to list the customers who rented out the film with title "BRIDE INTRIGUE" and then at some later date rented out the film with title "STAR OPERATION".
-- Use a CTE to simplify your code if possible.

  join rental using(customer_id)
  join inventory using (inventory_id)

  where film.title = 'BRIDE INTRIGUE'
  group by customer.customer_id )

join rental using(customer_id)
join inventory using (inventory_id)
join film using (film_id)
join min_bride_query on min_bride_query.customer_id = customer.customer_id
where film.title = 'STAR OPERATION'
  and rental.rental_date > min_bride_query.rental_date;

### Window Functions

Kind of like correlated subqueries but different.  

|function|what it does|example result|
|---|---|---|
|row_number|order sequential similar to regular numeric primary key|1,2,3,4,5,6,7|
|rank|ordered sequentially by row_number but with all equal having same number|1,2,3,3,3,6,7|
|dense_rank|ordered sequentially by rank but with all equal having same number|1,2,3,3,3,4,5|

example query
```
select 
 rating, 
 title,
 row_number() over (order by length),
 rank() over (order by length),
 dense_rank() over (order by length),
 dense_rank() over (group by rating order by length)
from film
```

The window for the function is easy to consider if you think of the partition as the actual window of data we are looking at.
Think of the window as being the restriction that is being applied by the partition.

```
select 
  title,
  avg(length) over (partition by rating)
from film

// for a film that has a a given rating of 'G'
avg(length) over (partition by rating)

// partitiion window expands on this
select rating, avg(length)
from film
group by rating
having rating = 'G';
```

When you add a "window frame" using an order by, aggregate functions will show a running total of the aggregate of the partition.
This is a default of how things work using a final 'rows between unbounded preceding current row'

You could adjust this and set it so that you could get something like a moving average of the last couple of days

```
select customer_id, payment_date, amount 
  avg(amount) over (partition by customer_id 
                    order by payment date
                    // implied
                    rows between unbounded preceding current row)

// To remove this behavior of having a running average you would change the 'rows between to be
rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following

// to get a running average of last 3 days
rows between 2 preceding rows and current row
```

As additional aggregate functions (sum, avg, etc) there is also 
 - lag: used to get back n value 
 - lead: used to get forward n value
 - ntile: percentile the current record is relative to window
 - cume_dist: distribution
 - first_value, nth_value and last_value: relative to the window *UP TO THE CURRENT ROW OF THE WINDOW BY DEFAULT*

### Working With Sets

Sets: Queries must return same number and data type of columns

For the most part, use parens to help on these

```
(...SQL) 
UNION 
(...OTHER_SQL)
```

Order / Group do not work on the result of a set, you have to wrap in a table subquery.

 - Union - All Unique Rows combined - put two sets together (a union b includes all in a and all in b) - Excluding Duplicates
 - Union All - All Rows combined - put two sets together (a union b includes all in a and all in b) - Keeping Duplicates
 - Intersect - find where both meet (a interesect b includes only those in a and b)
 - Intersect All - Return intersection where the rows in each result are the same
```
(select n from (values (1), (1), (3)) as v(n))
intersect
(select n from (values (1), (3), (4)) as v(n))
-- 1, 3

(select n from (values (1), (1), (3)) as v(n))
intersect
(select n from (values (1), (3), (4)) as v(n))
-- 1 (because the 1 only aligns in the first result row in both
``` 
 
 - Except - difference of two sets, order matters (a except b is the stuff that is in a that is NOT in b)
 - Except All - A 1 to 1 comparrison for the rows removing the ones that are the same
 
```
( select n from (values (1), (2), (3)) as v(n) )
except all
( select n from (values (1), (7), (8)) as v(n) )
-- 2, 3


( select n from (values (1), (1), (3)) as v(n) )
except all
( select n from (values (1), (7), (8)) as v(n) )
-- 1, 3


( select n from (values (1), (1), (1)) as v(n) )
except all
( select n from (values (1), (7), (8)) as v(n) )
-- 1, 1
``` 

#### Query Examples

--- 9.1 Write a query to list out all the distinct dates there was some sort of customer interaction (a rental or a payment) and order by output date

```

order by 1;

-- Solution, notice the cast
(

```

-- 9.4 The missing rental IDs problem that we've encountered several times now is the perfect place to use EXCEPT.
-- Write a query using the generate_series function and EXCEPT to find missing rental IDs (The rental table has 16,044
-- rows but the maximum rental ID is 16,049 - some IDs are missing)

```
-- mine
select * from generate_series(1, 16049)

    select date_trunc('day', rental_date) from rental
    union
    select date_trunc('day', payment_date) from payment) as all_dates(date)
order by 1 asc;

-- solution, note: adds a column to results so you can identify the source
(
  select cast(rental_date as date) as interaction_date, 'rental' as type
  from rental
)
union
(
  select cast(payment_date as date) as interaction_date, 'payment' as type
  from payment
)
order by interaction_date;
```

-- 9.7 Write a query to return the countries in which there are both customers and staff. Use a CTE to help simplify your code.

```
-- mine
(select country_id, country from customer
join address using(address_id)
join city using(city_id)
join country using(country_id))
intersect
(select country_id, country from staff
join store using(store_id)
join address on store.address_id = address.address_id
join city using(city_id)
join country using(country_id));

-- Soluetion, note the use of a CTE to make this more managable

with address_country as
(
  select address_id, country
  from address
    inner join city using (city_id)
    inner join country using (country_id)
)
(
  select country
  from staff
    inner join address_country using (address_id)
)
intersect
(
  select country
  from customer
    inner join address_country using (address_id)
);
```

-- 9.8 Imagine you had two queries - let's call them A and B. 
-- Can you figure out how you would use set operators to return the rows in either A or B, but not both.

(A INTERSECT B)
EXCEPT
(A UNION B)

### Tables and Constraints

Faces of SQL 
 - DDL (Data Definition Language) - Create, Alter, Drop
 - DML (Date Manipulation) - Insert, Update, Delete Select
 - DCL (Data Control) - Grant Revoke
 - TCL (Transaction Control) - Begin, Commit, Rollback
 
Good Touchups
 - Create Table `IF NOT EXISTS`
 - Drop Schema x `cascade` -> cascade purges all nested

```

-- 10.1 In this and the following exercises in this chapter, we're going to be doing some lightweight database
-- modelling work for a fictional beach equipment rental business.
-- Your answers may deviate a little from mine as we go, and that's fine -
-- database design is a quite subjective topic.
-- To kick things off, we'll keep working with our existing database
-- but we want to create all our tables within a schema called 'beach'. Write a SQL statement to create the 'beach' schema.

create schema beach;

-- 10.2 Create a table to store customers.
-- For each customer we want to capture their first name, last name, email address, phone number, and the date the account was created.
-- Don't worry about primary keys and constraints for now - just focus on the create statement
-- and choosing what you think are appropriate data types for the listed attributes.

create table beach.customers (
    first_name varchar(100),
    last_name varchar(100),
    email_address varchar(100),
    phone_number varchar(20),
    created_at date
)

-- 10.3 Create a table to store details about the equipment to be rented out.
-- For each item, we want to store the type ('surf board', 'kayak', etc.),
-- a general ad-hoc description of the item (color, brand, condition, etc),
-- and replacement cost so we know what to charge customers if they lose the item.

create table beach.equipment (
    type varchar(100) not null,
    description text,
    cost_in_cents integer
)

-- 10.4 After running the business for a while, we notice that customers sometimes lose equipment.
-- Write a SQL statement to alter the equipment table (assume it already has data in it we don't want to lose)
-- to add a column to track whether the item is missing.

alter table beach.equipment
  add column is_missing boolean default true;
```

### Primary Keys

surrogate and natural primary keys
 - surrogate -> Something that is artificial that will identify uniquely.  For instance `id`
 - natural -> Something that is inherently unique, vin number for cars, SSN for people
 
Syntax for declaring this will vary, can add `primary` or actually name it with something like
  `constraint YOUR_NAME_FOR_THIS_PK primary key (column)`
  
Composite Primary Keys -> Multiple Columns act as PK
  
Two ways to create an incremented pk in "modern syntax"
 - column_name type GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT } as IDENTITY
 - always = do this all the time
 - by default = do this if one is not provided
 
```

-- 10.5 Add a surrogate primary key for the customers table using the GENERATED AS IDENTITY syntax
-- (we assume not all customers will provide an email address or phone number ruling
-- them out as potential natural keys). Note you may drop the schema/table and re-create it
-- from scratch.

create table beach.customers (
    id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
    first_name varchar(100),
    last_name varchar(100),
    email_address varchar(100),
    phone_number varchar(20),
    created_at date
)

-- 10.6 Add a surrogate primary key for the equipment table using one of the serial types.
-- Also add in to the table definition the 'missing' column from exercise 10.4.
-- Note you may drop the schema/table and re-create it from scratch.

alter table beach.equipment
  add column id bigint generated always as identity primary key;

-- 10.7 Create a new table to store information about each rental with an appropriate primary key.
-- For each rental, store the customer, the item that was rented, the rental date, and the return date.

create table beach.rentals (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  equipment_id bigint not null,
  customer_id bigint not null,
  rental_date timestamp not null,
  return_date timestamp
``` 
=======

### Working with Sets
 
- union - combine two groups together removing duplicates (names of actors, customers and people)
- union all - union but do not remove duplicates
- intersect - distinct values that are in both groups are returned
- intersect all - intersect but keep duplicates that align exactly in position of results

#### Union
Data types on all columns selected must be the same, names do not

###

#TODO - need to do constraints, intersect and except, may ar

## Create Table and Constraints

### Foreign Keys

Protect referential integrity in systems.  Ensure that you are not going to create bad or invalid data.

You can tell postgres to cascade the delete/update to prevent having to do a whole lot of ordered deletes by appending to the references

    user_email varchar(100) references playground.users (email)
      on update cascade
      on delete cascade

```
// Our setup
create schema playground;
create table if not exists playground.users (
    email varchar(100),
    first_name varchar(100),
    last_name varchar(100),
    is_active boolean,
    constraint pk_users primary key (email)
);

create table playground.notes (
    note_id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
    note text,
    user_email varchar(100) references playground.users (email)
);

create table playground.note_tags (
    note_id bigint,
    tag varchar(20),
    primary key (note_id, tag),
    foreign key (note_id) references playground.notes (note_id)
);

// Insert a user into the system
insert into playground.users(email, first_name, last_name, is_active)
  values ('me@example.com', 'me', 'example', true);
```

#### Foreign key prevents inserting invalid data

Through inserts
```
insert into playground.notes(note, user_email)
  values ('foobarbar', 'someoneelse@example.com')

// Failes because of the database foreign key constraint that a exer_email references the users.email and there is no 'someoneelse@example.com'
 - user_email varchar(100) references playground.users (email)
```

Through updates
```
insert into playground.notes(note, user_email)
  values ('foobarbar', 'me@example.com');

update playground.notes
  set user_email = 'somethingelse@example.com'
  where user_email = 'me@example.com';
```
