## Module 2 Feedback

### Giving Feedback

#### How
- Written: Small, Straightforward.  Not a big deal if public.  
  - Someone made an error in code even with end to end tests
- Verbal: Complex, easily misinterpreted, Sensistive, not appropriate public
  - Cultural mismatch
  - Mistake in code, but bad attitude.  Defensive, unprofessional, snippy.
  - If it takes 10+ minutes to write feedback, good signal for 1 on 1

#### When
When should you give feedback.
 - Research: delays in feedback hurt performance and learning around course correction.
 - Small: within 24 hours
 - Bigger: 1:1 schedule within a week

Ask Yourself, when giving feedback, when did i deliver and how?

#### Delivering

Don't make a shit sandwich (good - bad -good).  It is predictable and sucks.  Disingenuous.

DO - 2A's (of netflix 4A's)  
 - Aim to Assist -> Try to actually help
 - Actionable -> Give something they can do

"I'd like to help ensure you are coming across as professional, it happened when X"

DO - (SBI, Situation Behavior Impact)
 - Outline the situation (context, specifics with what is happening), identify precise behavior (more specific is better), Impact that behavior had on team as opposed to characterization

DO - KYT Framework
 - Care: Come from a place of Care, intention.  Good intentions diffuse defensiveness.
 - Observation: Focus on observable behaviors, be specific.  When i saw "x" it made me feel "y".
 - Fallibility: Acknowledge it is your opinion
 - Curiousity: Not a monologue, feedback is a conversation, not a mandate
   - What do you think
    
Upward Feedback - Emphasize Care and Aim to Assist
 - I want to be clear my intention in sharing this is X
 - I want to be as helpful as possible x

Emphasize Fallability 
 - I realize I might not have all the information 
 - I was worried this feedback would be interpretted as X

Bias - Everwhere, numerous forms
 - idiosyncratic rater effect - 61% of feedback you give is a reflection of you, rather than the other person things

Debias Feedback
 - Ask a peer to review the feedback (is this an aim to assist)
 - Lean into fallibility.  What degree is this feedback a projection of my own perspective?
 - Focus on observable behaviors.  What precisely is not meetin gepxecations?  Were those made clear?
 - Imagine another team member behaving similarly, would your feedback be the same?
 - Review your own previous feedback, is it consistent across time and people?

### Receiving Feedback

The way we react to feedback sets the tone
 - Bad: Oh yeah we already tried that and .....

Why Bad Feedback Hurts
 - Truth Triggers - Hits hard and home
 - Relationship Trigger - Don't listen b/c don't trust others, don't know me (family feedback)
 - Identity Trigger - Feedback says about who you are (Conflate Behavior and Identity)

Think about these will help you understand and overcome this.

#### How to receive well

- 4 As (2'a) 
 - Appreciate the feedback: Thank for the feedback, tough to hear but appreciate
 - Accept or Discard:
   - Accept: "here is what i plan to do differently, i'm bookmarking this to reference in future"
   - Discard: focus on appreciate, "I see differently but respect how you feel" 

KTY
 - Make empathy your mission
 - Sit in silence for 3/4 seconds
 - Write it down, be thoughtful
 - Assume positive intent
 - Talk less

Consider:
 - Reflect on hardest piece of feedback that you received.  Which trigger made it difficult to receive
 - What tactics will you implement to try to better receive feedback

### Helping team get better at feedback

Enact "belonging cues"
- No one gives feedback unless they feel safe
 - Give psychological safety, belief that you won't be punished if you speak up
 - How? Belonging cues - Eye contact, verbal tone, body language  
  - How have you actively invited feedback?
  - Appreciation: Do you show appreciation the last piece of feedback you received
  - Vulnerability - Are you vulnerable about previous feedback
  - Personal Growth - Things you are improving on, do you personally share areas of growth/improvement you are getting better at
  - Taking Action: Do you act on feedback immediately
  - Curiousity: When you receive, do you respond with curiousity rather than Triggers
  - Delivery Critique: Do you ask for feedback on yoru delivery of the message?
  - Invitation: Do you invite feedcback on something specific 
  - Respect their Expertise
  - Avoid holding mistakes against the person  
- Don't triangulate the feedback (he said)
 - Don't be the go between, "Is this feedback you've directly shared with ___" (coach them)
- Model best practicies
 - When sharing bigger, sensitive feedback

## Module 3 Coaching

How can you be *Proactive* + avoid underperformance?

Remember: A good leader is someone who creates an environment for people to do their best work and achieve an outcome.
So motivating: Create the environment that helps employees tap into their own motivation.

Coach: Ask questions in a way that helps people tap into their motivation.

Question to self: How strongly would you fight to keep each person on your team?  If they gave their two week notice how would you respond.

### How to coach a top-performing employee
  So for each person
    - what is their core motivation
    - How can you better give choice to each person
    - How can better can you connect progress to their motivations  

  1. Find out what motivates them
    - Do we know what motivates your top-performers
     - When has it been a time you felt most motivated in the work you are doing, why, what project, who working with
     - What three events in your life have had the biggest impact on you, why
     - Who do you admin most in your life now, why
     - What do you value more than anything
     - What most deeply motivates you
    - Absorb observations for when they seem most excited + energetic about their work
  2. Give choice that aligns with their core motivation
    - What aspect of the last project did you enjoy the most so i can consider that for future projects?
    - How do you prefer to be recognized for a job well done
    - How can you increase choice for core performers
  3. Connect their work to *progress* towards their core motivation
    - eg: Career Progression: Here is how the work your doing will get you to the next level
    - Meaningful: Here is how the work your doing directly impacts this problem we are trying to solve
   
### How to coach an underperforming employee

Consideration
- What outward or inward questions can help you to understand
- Do you have Problem A or B
- Is there a reason i haven't setup a PIP


1. Ignore your instincts, ask questions
 - Ignore Instincts: giving leeway or finding blame, you may be right, but assuming is not knowing why
 - to find, you must ask Questions, not accusations

 Outward Q: What on the employee's end is limiting them?
  - How have you been feeling about your own performance lately
  - What are you enjoying most about wha tyou are doing, what is inspiring?
  - What part do you feel stuck?
  - WHat part of the work is "meh"?
  - When is last time you talked to a customer that benefited, would you like more opps to do that, 
  - Do you feel like you are playing to your strengths, 
  - Are you optimistic, pessimistic about the teams future
 Inward Q: What on my end is limiting them? 
  - Is it clear what needs to get done, how do i make things more clear
  - Is level of quality clear, what 
  - Am i being respectful of the amount of time you have to accomplish something, can i be guarding time better
  - Do you feel you're being set up to fail in any way, are my expectations realistic, should i adjust what i expect
  - Do you have tools and resources
  - Do you have enough context to know why 
  - Has anything irked you about my management style

To what degree have you been assuming you know the root cause of underperformance
What outward + inward questions can you ask to uncover root cause of underperformance

Ask both of them

2. Problem A or B

Ask: How have you been feeling about your own performance lately?
 - A: I have been in a rut lately
 - B: Rocking and Rolling!

- A: The team member knows they are underperforming
 - You have talked to them about it, the problem doesn't understand the `consequences` of unacceptable performance
 - 1. Recognize the problem: Ask the person to reflect beforehand about their performance
 - 2. Identify the cause: Ask inward + outward questions
 - 3. Explore possible solutions: Discuss options together
 - 4. Outline next steps: Agree on actions you'll both take
- B: The team member does not know they are underperforming, they don't know expectations
 - The person doesn't understand what an acceptable level of performance is
 - Clarify acceptable level of performance
 - 1. How do you know the employee is underperforming?
 - 2. How can you articulate the expected level of performance?

*PITFALL*
- Good performance is clear to you but not the employee?
 - How should we define success, is definition clear, how will we know when we have been successful?
- Employee's subpar performance is clear to you, but not the employee?
 - Be observational, when i observed __, i notice it affected __
 - THis occurred __ times on __ dates
 - These are the words/etc
 - Our expecations for this role are __
 - This is falling short in these ways:

THE CRUX IS CLARITY

3. Consider a PIP (performance improvement plan)
- lever or a crutch
- Never make PIP a surprise
- Let team member know that a PIP is a possibility
- Consider having others present for the conversation
1. Meet with team member to discuss PIP.  Make purpose clear ahead of time.
2. Together define success tangibly 
3. Develop plan during meetings
4. Setup 4-6 weekly checkpoints
5. During each checkpoint, discuss progress to date
6. Last, declare success

Draft plan always with employee's input
Understand cultural implications of PIP

Don't surprise them and include the employee's input

Final Tips
- Emphasize how it benefits your team member to talk through
- I'm sharing feedback because i want you to have a productive relationship, because i care about your career progression
- Can we think of ways to approach this differently in the future, what are alternate paths, here are suggestions for what we can do what do you think?

- Follow up with written confirmation

Hi __, thanks for giving me space earlier to talk about n, want to ensure we are on the same page
- Y behavior didn't meet expectations
- Reiterate clearly
