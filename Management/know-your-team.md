## Module 3 Feedback

### Giving Feedback

#### How
- Written: Small, Straightforward.  Not a big deal if public.  
  - Someone made an error in code even with end to end tests
- Verbal: Complex, easily misinterpreted, Sensistive, not appropriate public
  - Cultural mismatch
  - Mistake in code, but bad attitude.  Defensive, unprofessional, snippy.
  - If it takes 10+ minutes to write feedback, good signal for 1 on 1

#### When
When should you give feedback.
 - Research: delays in feedback hurt performance and learning around course correction.
 - Small: within 24 hours
 - Bigger: 1:1 schedule within a week

Ask Yourself, when giving feedback, when did i deliver and how?

#### Delivering

Don't make a shit sandwich (good - bad -good).  It is predictable and sucks.  Disingenuous.

DO - 2A's (of netflix 4A's)  
 - Aim to Assist -> Try to actually help
 - Actionable -> Give something they can do

"I'd like to help ensure you are coming across as professional, it happened when X"

DO - (SBI, Situation Behavior Impact)
 - Outline the situation (context, specifics with what is happening), identify precise behavior (more specific is better), Impact that behavior had on team as opposed to characterization

DO - KYT Framework
 - Care: Come from a place of Care, intention.  Good intentions diffuse defensiveness.
 - Observation: Focus on observable behaviors, be specific.  When i saw "x" it made me feel "y".
 - Fallibility: Acknowledge it is your opinion
 - Curiousity: Not a monologue, feedback is a conversation, not a mandate
   - What do you think
    
Upward Feedback - Emphasize Care and Aim to Assist
 - I want to be clear my intention in sharing this is X
 - I want to be as helpful as possible x

Emphasize Fallability 
 - I realize I might not have all the information 
 - I was worried this feedback would be interpretted as X

Bias - Everwhere, numerous forms
 - idiosyncratic rater effect - 61% of feedback you give is a reflection of you, rather than the other person things

Debias Feedback
 - Ask a peer to review the feedback (is this an aim to assist)
 - Lean into fallibility.  What degree is this feedback a projection of my own perspective?
 - Focus on observable behaviors.  What precisely is not meetin gepxecations?  Were those made clear?
 - Imagine another team member behaving similarly, would your feedback be the same?
 - Review your own previous feedback, is it consistent across time and people?

### Receiving Feedback

The way we react to feedback sets the tone
 - Bad: Oh yeah we already tried that and .....

Why Bad Feedback Hurts
 - Truth Triggers - Hits hard and home
 - Relationship Trigger - Don't listen b/c don't trust others, don't know me (family feedback)
 - Identity Trigger - Feedback says about who you are (Conflate Behavior and Identity)

Think about these will help you understand and overcome this.

#### How to receive well

- 4 As (2'a) 
 - Appreciate the feedback: Thank for the feedback, tough to hear but appreciate
 - Accept or Discard:
   - Accept: "here is what i plan to do differently, i'm bookmarking this to reference in future"
   - Discard: focus on appreciate, "I see differently but respect how you feel" 

KTY
 - Make empathy your mission
 - Sit in silence for 3/4 seconds
 - Write it down, be thoughtful
 - Assume positive intent
 - Talk less

Consider:
 - Reflect on hardest piece of feedback that you received.  Which trigger made it difficult to receive
 - What tactics will you implement to try to better receive feedback

### Helping team get better at feedback

Enact "belonging cues"
- No one gives feedback unless they feel safe
 - Give psychological safety, belief that you won't be punished if you speak up
 - How? Belonging cues - Eye contact, verbal tone, body language  
  - How have you actively invited feedback?
  - Appreciation: Do you show appreciation the last piece of feedback you received
  - Vulnerability - Are you vulnerable about previous feedback
  - Personal Growth - Things you are improving on, do you personally share areas of growth/improvement you are getting better at
  - Taking Action: Do you act on feedback immediately
  - Curiousity: When you receive, do you respond with curiousity rather than Triggers
  - Delivery Critique: Do you ask for feedback on yoru delivery of the message?
  - Invitation: Do you invite feedcback on something specific 
  - Respect their Expertise
  - Avoid holding mistakes against the person  
- Don't triangulate the feedback (he said)
 - Don't be the go between, "Is this feedback you've directly shared with ___" (coach them)
- Model best practicies
 - When sharing bigger, sensitive feedback
