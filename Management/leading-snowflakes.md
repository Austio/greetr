## Leading Snowflakes

### Chapter 1: Modes of Operation

- Carefully balance two modes
 - Manager 
   - Measured by our ability to amplify and scale our team (clear obstacles, train, communicate, veolocity, experiment)
   - Don't neglect managerial responsibilities for immediate gratifications of shipping
   - Interruptions are here so that we can help others do things
 - Maker
   - Measured by ability to complete tasks
   - Managers still need this to be in touch with what we are responsible for 
     - Try to keep these simple and small <4 hours 
     - Try to keep them off critical path
     - Try to work on things that boost velocity (new tech process, boot talent acquisition)
   
 - Find a way to convey when you are in which context

 - [Rands Technicality](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/technicality/)
   - Stay flexible and don't stop developing 
   - You must program some to be able to see how software development is changing within your company
   - Be able to draw a detailed arch diagram of your product on a whiteboard at any time
   - Own a feature so that you own it and must understand the thing 

- [Maker/Manager Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)
  - Clearly understand and convey the different modes you are in.  Keep maker time free of distraction, keep manager time open to help people

- Takeaways
  - Calendars: Clockwise gives you the option to ensure there is a break in between meetings
  - Which events are 1 on 1 vs group events, give them different colors
  - Events can be defaulted from 30 minutes to 25 and 1 hour and 50 minutes

### Chapter 2: Peer Reviewing Management Decisions

"Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out" -- Rober Collier

Receiving constant feedback is the fastest way to learn.  When faced with a hasty decision keep a captains log to compare what you did with how it ended up.  Things to capture: When, Who, The Delimma, The Decision, Retrospection, Did I share it with someone

Great times to do this
  - 1:1 with boss
  - Another engineering manager
  - 1:1 with teammates
  - 10 minutes daily ritual
  - 1 hour monthly ritual

Some questions you could ask when going over them.
 - The Delimma
   - How many were raised: Are there recurring issues from tech debt, is tech debut under control.
   - Can we spot personal issues between teammates: How to create trust, what impact does it have on relationships.
   - Is it coming from one person: Do they lack context, experience, expertise
   - Can we spot repeating issues with other teams
 - The Decision
   - How many were made by use: Did the team need *US* to decide, did we suggest options, could someone else answer
   - Would we do something differently now?: Maybe asked boss to move deadline in 2 days to give time and increase accountability
 - Did I Share it with someone: Share 50% with people
 
- Takeaways
  - Daily reminder for 10 minutes to write things down
  - Monthly for 1 hour
  - Pick a management buddy for this
  
### - Chapter 3 - Push Your Team

[Dick Costello Do Not Try to be Liked](https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/09/dick-costolo-warns-against-trying-to-be-liked-and-lionizing-silicon-valley-figures/)

Act from a deep belief of what is right for my team.  Be forthright and clear.

Focus on what you can give someone for being on your team, not just learning how to write good code but also
  - asking the right questions
  - looking at the bigger picture
  
Care Deeply about your people while not worrying about what they think about you
  - empathy: understanding someone else's perspective, we understand how they analyze the situation.  We don't have to agree, share feelings or help them solve
  - sympathy: empathy + feeling the same way as the other person, feeling as if we were that person

If someone is not performing well, emplathy will help us to analyze their situation; was it mismanagement of expectations, external conditions affecting.  Sympathy will trigger feelings of our past failures and justifying behaviors that we otherwise would not.  Sympathy cuases us to act as if we were the ones failing which prevents being subjective.

Anti Asshole Checklist 
 - Did I show and act from a place of empathy?  Reflect the situation as you see it to determine.
 - Did I clarify my expectations? 
 - Did I practice what i just preached?
 
Things that will help
 - Share lessons learning
 - Summarize and Followup.  In that summary explain how you understood the other side along with the next action items
  - Have concrete examples for followup
 - Use the right medium.  Some teams are able to handle this in 1:1 some are good with group
  - use [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys) by asking why something happened 5 times to get to the root
 - Provide immediate feedback: not making a decision is equally a decision as making one
   
### - Chapter 4 - Teach how to get things done

[Show How, Don't Tell What](https://tomayko.com/blog/2012/management-style)

Teach teamates how to plan, build and deliver by pairing with them.

Reflect on our thoughts and reasoning while we work: Make sure the "Why" is as visible and obvious as the "how"
Make sure everyone has the information they need to do their job effectively.  

Reduce Risk and Wast by
 - Really focus on helping people to break down tasks, the smaller the better
 - Show how to communicate questions of making things smaller (how to release small to qa, product, support, ops, etc)
 - Have alternatives for if the deploy goes poorly.
 - Break features into smaller tasks to increase deadline feasibility
 
 By breaking things down, it helps people build confidence in the feasibility of the deadline we're communicating.
  - Shorter Iterations
  - LInk dependencies
  
 Constantly Communicate what is holding up, what that means for deadline.
 
 Show how, Dont' Tell What
  - You don't scale, you can't always be there to tell what to do
  - Telling people what to do is lazy, 
  
 Not explainging why causes lack of commitment and burnout
 
 Drive Book - Healthy environment 
  - Autonomy: how decisions are made
  - Mastery: challenging and engaging
  - Purpose: why you are doing something
 
### Chapter 5 - Delegate without losing quality/visibility

What should we do with our time in order to build a highly effective team that enjoys working together?

Delegate:
 - set expectations
 - trust
 
Make a list of must / delegate / external
 - for each must
   - does it utilize my strength/responsibility as manager
   - does it server the leader i want to become in the long run (push out of comfort zone)
 - if no on both, delegate to other teammates  
 
Must (personal)
 - Implementing Risky Features
 - Planning milestones/deliveries
 - Assigning tasks
 - Code Reviews
 - Communicating requirements/progress with other teams
 - Communicating with business to make sure on time
 - Interviewing
 
Must (leader): tasks we believe are crucial for our team's success
 - prepare growth plan for each teammate
 - meeting with members

External
 - expectations for 1 on 1's with boss
 
Delegating: Set expectations/desires explicitly
 - Goal: Someone to take ownership
 - What do i want to happen; Be communicative, active (ownership) aware
 - Effort includes (x,y,z)
 - Criteria for success


### Chapter 6 - Build trust with other teams

Functional Aspects of teams are well defined, but keeping them aligned is a challenge.  Conveying these explicity expectations is beneficial

Problems with a fractured outlook on management
 - Lacking vision alignment: Teams don't know what their vision is.  We need to define that for them and what the vision is for the team.  Set the vision.
 - Different Prioritizaiton and lack of context from other teams: Multiple managers with mixed understanding of expectations trying to communicate gets messy.
  - Need vs want misalignment: be sure to define what a need is vs a want so that you can classify and manage urgency/important things.
  - Remove dependencies: Align teams to start optimizing for value, getting the "right things" done faster rather than optimizing our local throughput (getting work done faster)
 

Building Trust starts with consistently sharing context, priorities and pains as part of execution process. 

### Chapter 7: Optimize for Business Learning

Don't fall in love with the solution, but the problem you're trying to solve.

Optimize for What?

First Figure out the Busines Value of Features
 - Will we know when/how people hear about our product?
 - Will we be able to understand if/how they use product?
 - Can we change things quickly enough to improve the product?
 - Can we measure quality of changes?
 - Can we reduce the amount of work and test earlier?

Focus on Efficiency over Throughput
 - Efficiency: Reduce number of Work Units
 - Throughput: More tasks in given time period

Optimize for Value:
 - Acquisition - how do you bring in more users
 - Activation - Complete tasks that help convey value of application (1st time experience) think alarm clock proposition
 - Retention - Increase repetive visits
 - Referrer - INcentivise to bring in new audience
 - Revenue - Monetize users/customers
 
Understand the impact of a feature
 - have analytics in place to focus on improving metrics above 
 - "If you can't make engineering decisions based on data, then make engineering decisions that result in data." Kent Beck
 
Optimizing or scaling components that may/may not be used is sticking our head in the sand, massive infrastructure work and automating irrelevant manual steps are bad.

With business certainty, optimize for predictability

Figure out and optimize bottlenecks
 - Resolve dependencies in advance (design vs engineering)
 - Infrastructure - reduce code neded to develop new features
 - Automate manual work
 
Companies fail when they stop asking what they would do if they were started today and instead just iterate on what they've already done.
