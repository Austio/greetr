## Leading Snowflakes

### Chapter 1: Modes of Operation

- Carefully balance two modes
 - Manager 
   - Measured by our ability to amplify and scale our team (clear obstacles, train, communicate, veolocity, experiment)
   - Don't neglect managerial responsibilities for immediate gratifications of shipping
   - Interruptions are here so that we can help others do things
 - Maker
   - Measured by ability to complete tasks
   - Managers still need this to be in touch with what we are responsible for 
     - Try to keep these simple and small <4 hours 
     - Try to keep them off critical path
     - Try to work on things that boost velocity (new tech process, boot talent acquisition)
   
 - Find a way to convey when you are in which context

   - You must program some to be able to see how software development is changing within your company
   - Be able to draw a detailed arch diagram of your product on a whiteboard at any time
   - Own a feature so that you own it and must understand the thing

### Chapter 2: Peer Reviewing Management Decisions

"Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out" -- Rober Collier

Receiving constant feedback is the fastest way to learn.  When faced with a hasty decision keep a captains log to compare what you did with how it ended up.  Things to capture: When, Who, The Delimma, The Decision, Retrospection, Did I share it with someone

Great times to do this
  - 1:1 with boss
  - Another engineering manager
  - 1:1 with teammates
  - 10 minutes daily ritual
  - 1 hour monthly ritual

Some questions you could ask when going over them.
 - The Delimma
   - How many were raised: Are there recurring issues from tech debt, is tech debut under control.
   - Can we spot personal issues between teammates: How to create trust, what impact does it have on relationships.
   - Is it coming from one person: Do they lack context, experience, expertise
   - Can we spot repeating issues with other teams
 - The Decision
   - How many were made by use: Did the team need *US* to decide, did we suggest options, could someone else answer
   - Would we do something differently now?: Maybe asked boss to move deadline in 2 days to give time and increase accountability
 - Did I Share it with someone: Share 50% with people
 
 
- Takeaways
  - Daily reminder for 10 minutes to write things down
  - Monthly for 1 hour
  - Pick a management buddy for this
