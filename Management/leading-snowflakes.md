   - Measured by our ability to amplify and scale our team (clear obstacles, train, communicate, veolocity, experiment)

   - Interruptions are here so that we can help others do things
 - Maker

   - Managers still need this to be in touch with what we are responsible for 
     - Try to keep these simple and small <4 hours 
     - Try to keep them off critical path
