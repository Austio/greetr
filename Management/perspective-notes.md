### [Building Exclusive Teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYsI-6_csMY&amp;index=6&amp;t=0s
)
- Goal: Make team a place where hard working, collaborative, smart people from all background can succeed and thrive
- Culture: Set of behaviors that are rewarded and punishment

Why do people leave
 - Perceived promoted rate relative to peers -> 
 - Lower performance reviews for the same work ->
 - Microagressions? -> 
   - Need email to sound like it came from google not a nigerian (!)
    - don't wait to address this after meeting/hr, 
    - give feedback with kindness: "i don't think that sounded how you meant it to sound"
      - it shows the team that it is unacceptable and it helps the person making the mistake to correct
   - Your culture will change based on the response to a microaggression
   
What is Privileged?
 - The preferred group for the given context.  This can be white vs black in america.  Designers at apple, mba's at amazon, engineers at google

This is something that you can 'lend' in certain situations.  Great example
 - woman is interrupted in meeting, she can either speak up or not and both are not great
  - someone else that is a leader could speak up and lend privelege
 - Black person saying to a black group that something is wrong
 
Focus on the 'truth' in the critism related to privilege.  Be aware of the truth.
