Should be led by manager in the sense that it is a way to get perspective
 - explain the purpose of the 1 on 1 meeting (uncover potential issues, what's on mind, on same page)

The best way to ensure they are engaged is to get feedback on length, focus and cadence of meeting

Mindset:
 - Information Gathering: Listen, show we are paying attention, write things down
 - Uncover potential issues, not judgement
 - Empower them to come to me early

Write Things Down as you Have these

Remote 1:1
 - personal connection, heed off loneliness
 - How is your energy level these days, music, watching, cook anything, podcasts
 - This is not status update
 - Ask about their remote work environment itself
   - clear what needs to be done, level of quality that's required clear
   - am i being respectful of time
   - do you have tools and resources to get things done
   - when you do feel like you get the best work done
   - what part of work do you feel stuck at

Feedback
 - anything that has irked you wrong way about my management style

Company Team Outlook
 - how do you feel about direction, transparency
 - what can we communicate more often and transparency, to help reduce anxiety around team's/company's future 
 - what are the things that need/could change or need to continue
 
 For when there is something that is related to red-tape that you can't change
 - be empathetic and have candor at the same time
 
What happens when you are more busy:
 - remember it is a conversation with a person
 - it will help the team
