## Team Dynamics

3 types of teams
 - pathological (power oriented) - large amounts of fear/thread.  People hoard information or withhold it for political reasons or distort it to make themselves look better
 - bureaucratic (rule oriented) - orgs protect departments, departments want to maintain turf and insist on their own rules and do things by (their) book.
 - generative (performance oriented) - orgs focus on the mission, how do we accomplish our goal, everything is subordinate to good performance, to doing what we are supposed to

Good orgs have good information flow, where that information: 
 - provides answers to the questions that the receiver needs
 - it is timely
 - it is presented in such a way that it can be effectively used by the receiver

PG 67: Good questionaire to determine org type
 - Informaiton is actively sought
 - Messengers are not punished when delivering failures/bad news
 - Responsibilities are shared
 - Cross functional collab is encouraged and rewarded
 - Failure causes inquiry
 - New ideas are welcomed
 - Failures are treated primarily as opportunities to improve

- Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work and view their contributions.  It all comes down to team dynamics

## Measuring

 - Three constructs for measuring effective organizaionts
   - Deployment Frequency — How often an organization successfully releases to production
   - Lead Time for Changes — The amount of time it takes a commit to get into production 
   - Time to Restore Service—How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production
   - (forth non correlated) Change Failure Rate—The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production

## Technical Practices

Continuous Delivery has a high impact on org outcomes.  We create multiple feedback loops to ensure high quality software is delivered to users more frequently and more reliably.

Defined: Capabilities that enable us to get changes into prod safely, quickly and sustainably
 - Build In Quality
 - Work in Small Batches
 - Computers perform repetitive tasks; people solve problems
 - Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement
 - Everyone is responsible

To enable we need: 
 - Comprehensive Configuration Management
 - Continuous Integration
 - Continuous Testing

Drivers of Continuous Delivery
 - Version Control
 - Deployment Automation
 - Continuous Integratoin
 - Trunk Based Development
 - Test Automation
 - Test Data Management
 - Shift Left on Security
 - Loosely Coupled Architecture
 - Empowered Teams
 - Monitoring
 - Proactive Notifications

Impact of Continuous Delivery:
 - Less Deployment Pain
 - Less Team Burnout
 - More time to spend on "New work" instead of "old work (regressions)"
